# Master’s Thesis — Behaviour Trees for Horror Game AI

**Degree Programme:** Digital Graphics and Animation (MSc)  
**Study Field:** Informatics Engineering  
**Focus:** AI behaviour modelling, gameplay systems, horror design  
**Status:** Research & literature analysis phase

## Overview
This repository documents my ongoing Master’s thesis developed within the *Digital Graphics and Animation* study programme.

The thesis focuses on the use of **Behaviour Trees** to model antagonist behaviour in horror games, with an emphasis on **interactive digital systems**, **real-time animation**, and **player perception**.

While the research explores AI behaviour modelling, its primary goal is to support believable, controllable character behaviour within animated, interactive environments, particularly in VR contexts.

## Research Focus
- Behaviour Trees as a control structure for animated game characters
- Antagonist behaviour modelling in horror games
- Relationship between behaviour logic, animation, and player perception
- Design considerations for interactive and VR-based horror experiences

## Current Stage
- Literature analysis and comparative research
- Review of existing AI behaviour modelling methods
- Definition of design constraints and evaluation criteria

## Planned Work
- Behaviour Tree model design for a horror antagonist
- Integration considerations for a VR game environment
- Evaluation of control, flexibility, and player experience impact

## Relation to Practice
The outcomes of this research are intended to inform the development of a future VR horror prototype, where Behaviour Trees will be used to control character behaviour in conjunction with animation systems and real-time interaction.

## Notes
This repository reflects work in progress.  
Implementation and evaluation will be added as the thesis progresses.
